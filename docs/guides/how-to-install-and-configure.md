# Installing and Configuring MCP Gateway

This guide demonstrates how to install and configure MCP Gateway to aggregate multiple Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers behind a single endpoint.

## Prerequisites

### Kubernetes Cluster Options

MCP Gateway runs on Kubernetes and integrates with Gateway API and Istio. You should be familiar with:
- **Kubernetes** - Basic kubectl and YAML knowledge
- **Gateway API** - Kubernetes standard for traffic routing
- **Istio** - Service mesh and Gateway API provider

**Choose your setup approach:**

**Option A: Quick Start (5 minutes)**
- Want to try MCP Gateway immediately with minimal setup
- Automated script handles everything for you
- Perfect for evaluation and testing
- **[Quick Start Guide](./quick-start.md)**

**Option B: Existing Cluster**
- You have a Kubernetes cluster with Gateway API CRDs and Istio installed
- Ready to deploy MCP Gateway immediately

**Option C: Local Development Cluster**  
- Set up a local Kind cluster with all prerequisites
- See: [Kind Cluster Setup Guide](./kind-cluster-setup.md)

### MCP Servers

You'll need at least one MCP server to route through the gateway. This can be:
- Internal services running in your cluster
- External MCP servers (like GitHub's MCP API)
- Test servers for evaluation

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Helm (Recommended)

Install from GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
helm install mcp-gateway oci://ghcr.io/kagenti/charts/mcp-gateway --create-namespace --namespace mcp-system
```

This automatically installs:
- MCP Gateway components (broker, router, controller)
- Required CRDs and RBAC
- EnvoyFilter for Istio integration

### Method 2: Kustomize

Install using Kubernetes manifests:

```bash
kubectl apply -k 'https://github.com/kagenti/mcp-gateway/config/install?ref=main'
```

This provides the same components as Helm but with less configuration flexibility.

### Method 3: Standalone Installation (Advanced)

For non-Kubernetes deployments or advanced use cases, see [Standalone Installation Guide](./binary-install.md).

**Note:** This method is not fully supported and requires manual configuration of routing and service discovery. Most guides in this documentation use Kubernetes-based setup, leveraging CRDs and kubectl commands.

## Post-Installation Configuration

After installation, you'll need to configure the gateway and connect your MCP servers:

1. **[Configure Gateway Listener and Route](./configure-mcp-gateway-listener-and-router.md)** - Set up traffic routing
2. **[Configure MCP Servers](./configure-mcp-servers.md)** - Connect internal MCP servers  
3. **[Connect External MCP Servers](./external-mcp-server.md)** - Connect to external APIs

## Optional Configuration

- **[Authentication](./authentication.md)** - Configure OAuth-based authentication
- **[Authorization](./authorization.md)** - Set up fine-grained access control
- **[Virtual MCP Servers](./virtual-mcp-servers.md)** - Create focused tool collections
